# Features  
  
- Parse a website for specific filetypes.  
- Filter results.  
- Text or regex replace filenames.  
- Download and log the file's url, so that on next parse downloaded files will not be relisted even if renamed. (the idea is to get new files only)  
- File with urls  and base url inputs (base url is for when a file link is not a full url like www.url.com/file.txt but relative like /media/file.txt)  
- Save/Load Main/Relative URLS and filetypes, as well as regex find/replace pairs.  
- Print files on download (atm working around pdfs but will try to implement more filetypes)
